MDS Checker - Readme
Author: Jonas Markstr√∂m / swjm.blog
Version: 1.0.0

Release Date: October 2024

Description
===========
MDS Checker is a lightweight Windows utility that provides the following key features:

1. It first reads the AAGUID from an inserted YubiKey
2. It then checks if the AAGUID exists in the Fido MDS
3. Lastly, presents the AAGUID in an IdP-friendly format

These features greatly simplify tasks related to AAGUID white-listing and aides the user in assessing the likelihood of performing successful attestation checks.

Usage
======
1. double-click mds-checker.exe to run the app
2. Approve elevation (run-as) when prompted(!)
3. Insert a YubiKey to aquire it's AAGUID (this happens automatically)
4. Use the Copy button (shown onlt on successful MDS matching) to copy the AAGUID to clipboard
5. Optionally paste the AAGUID into your IdP (RP) for white-listing purposes.

NOTE: The app must be run as administrator!

Known Issues
============
Currently, the utility does not support multi-device detection.
