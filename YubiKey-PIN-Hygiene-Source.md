# 🔐 YubiKey PIN – Do’s & Don’ts

Your YubiKey PIN protects both your identity and your organization’s security.  
Treat it like the password to your professional reputation — **keep it safe!**

---

## ✅ DO’S

- **Choose a unique PIN.** Don’t reuse one from anywhere else.  
- **Create a PIN you won’t forget.** A short phrase (letters are fine) can make it easier to recall.  
- **Keep it secret.** No one else should ever know your PIN.  
- **Remember it — don’t record it.** Avoid storing it on paper, your phone, or your computer.  
- **Change it immediately** if you suspect someone saw you entering it.

## ❌ DON’TS

- Don’t use obvious or easy-to-guess PINs (like “1234,” birthdays, or names).  
- Don’t write your PIN down — not in your wallet, notes app, or anywhere else.  
- Don’t share it with anyone — not even IT staff, managers, or coworkers.  
- Don’t reuse your YubiKey PIN for other devices or accounts.  
- Don’t type it where others can watch (e.g., in public).

💡 **Protect your PIN, and it will protect you — and your company.**
