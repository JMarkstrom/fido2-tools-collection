## MDS Checker
MDS Checker is a lightweight Windows utility that provides the following key features:

1. It first reads the AAGUID from an inserted YubiKey
2. It then checks if the AAGUID exists in the Fido MDS
3. Lastly, presents the AAGUID in an IdP-friendly format

These features greatly simplify tasks related to AAGUID white-listing and aides the user in assessing the likelihood of performing successful attestation checks.

### üìñ Usage
1. double-click ```mds-checker.exe``` to run the app
2. Approve elevation (run-as) when prompted(!)
3. Insert a YubiKey to aquire it's AAGUID (this happens automatically)
4. Use the Copy button (shown onlt on successful MDS matching) to copy the AAGUID to clipboard
5. Optionally paste the AAGUID into your IdP (RP) for white-listing purposes.

**NOTE**: The app must be run as administrator!


## YubiKey PIN Generator
The [YubiKey PIN Generator](/yubikey-pin-gen.py) is a Python script that facilitates configuration of a YubiKey(s). The script:

- Sets a random and non-trivial PIN (default: ```4``` digits)
- If selected (and supported by the YubiKey) sets PIN to expire on first use
- Prints YubiKey model, serial number, intial PIN (and change flag) to a JSON output file
- Prompts for configuration of additional YubiKey(s).

## üíª Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites towards running the script:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on client
- [Python-fido2](https://github.com/Yubico/python-fido2) installed on client
- [Yubikey Manager](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager) (CLI) installed on client. 

**NOTE**: Refer to [swjm.blog](https://swjm.blog) for _detailed_ setup instructions.

### üìñ Usage
To run the script, simply execute command: `python yubikey-pin-gen.py`

**NOTE**: Refer to [swjm.blog](https://swjm.blog) for _detailed_ usage instructions.

## üóé The output.json file
The script will outout a file on working directory called output.json. 

Here is an example: 

```json
[
    {
      "Model": "YubiKey 5C NFC",
      "Serial number": 12345678,
      "PIN": "6855",
      "PIN change required": true
    }
]
```

# Assembled list of Fido AAGUIDs 
The AAGUID, short for "Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier" is part of the FIDO2 specification. The AAGUID (in most cases) identifies the authenticator _make and model_. As such it allows the Relying Party (RP) or Identity Provider (IdP) a simple way to include (or exclude) authenticators during registration/enrollment and authentication without for example implementing the Fido Metadata Service. 

A CSV file containing "all" AAGUIDs can be found [here](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/blob/main/FIDO2-AAGUIDs.csv).

# Enable Security Key Logon

## Registry keys
The [file](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/blob/main/Enable-Security-Key-Logon.reg) `Enable-Security-Key-Logon.reg` contains a registry key that will enable security key logon on Windows 10 & Windows 11.

### üìñ Usage
To use this registry key, download it or save content to file (with .reg extension) and double-click on it.

## Administrative template (ADMX)
The archive [file](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/blob/main/Enable-Security-Key-Sign-in-ADMX-1.0.zip) `Enable-Security-Key-Sign-in-ADMX-1.0.zip` adds security key sign-in as a GPO control to the existing credentialproviders.admx view (not the file itself) to "augment" a Windows Server GPO where this control is not yet available (e.g on Windows Server 2019 and earlier).

### üìñ Usage
For usage instructions, see readme.txt inside the archive.

## Provisioning package
The [file](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/raw/main/Enable-Security-Key-Sign-in-1.0.ppkg) `Enable-Security-Key-Sign-in-1.0.ppkg` contains a provisioning package that will enable security key logon on Windows 10 & Windows 11. The package is unsigned and not encryped.

### üìñ Usage
To use this package download it and double-click on it (or import into Windows Configuration Designer and go from there).

# Enforce Security Key Logon

## Registry keys
The [file](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/blob/main/Disable-PasswordProvider.reg) `Disable-PasswordProvider.reg` contains a registry key that will DISABLE password-based logon on Windows 10 & Windows 11.

### üìñ Usage
To use this registry key, download it or save content to file (with .reg extension) and double-click on it.
To disable _ _additional_ _ credential providers you can expand this key using a listing provided at https://swjm.blog

## script
The [file](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/blob/main/Enforce_security_key_sign-in.ps1) `Enforce_security_key_sign-in.ps1` constitutes a PowerShell script meant for **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** (Intune) configuration of Windows 10 and 11 clients. The script is _ _adapted_ _ from an original script created by **Craig Wilson** (https://craigwilson.blog/) and works by DISABLING alternative credential providers.

### üìñ Usage
See: https://swjm.blog


# Add Kerberos object from on-premise AD to Azure AD           
The [file](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/blob/main/Add-Kerberos-object-to-AAD.ps1) `Add-Kerberos-object-to-AAD.ps1` PowerShell script is designed to establish an Azure AD Kerberos Server object within your on-premise AD, enabling seamless FIDO2 (SSO) access to on-premise resources like network shares. It's important to note that this isn't mandatory for FIDO2 security key sign-in, but it does broaden the scope of security key utilization beyond PC login.

### üìñ Usage
See: https://swjm.blog

# Terms of Use (ToU) Passkeys
The [file](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/blob/main/Terms-of-Use-(ToU)-Passkeys.pdf) `Terms-of-Use-(ToU)-Passkeys.pdf` is an example of a "Terms of Use" (ToU) that can be presented to users when accessing company resources. This example ToU stipulates that users must set a non-trivial PIN on the security key and transfers the responsibility to the user. 

### üìñ Usage
